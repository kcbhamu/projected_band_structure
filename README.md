# projected_band_structure

## Utility
To plot atomic orbitals projected band structure from `vasp` output file `KPOINTS` and `PROCAR`.

## Guide
> Code should be modified for different systems.
``` python projected_band_structure_v1.py
```
## bugs
1. the `for` loop for extracting band energies and calculating the projection parameter is **VERY SLOW**.
2. ?
