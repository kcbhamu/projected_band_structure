# projected_band_structure

## Utility
To plot atomic-orbital-projected band structure from `VASP` output files `KPOINTS` , `OUTCAR` and `PROCAR`.

## Guide
Most part of the code should be modified for your system.

## bugs
1. The `for` loop for extracting band energies and calculating the projection parameter is **EXTREMELY SLOW**.
2. ...
